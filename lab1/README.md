Inside the file solution.ipynb there are 3 different solutions.

The first solution produces results in a reasonable time only up to N = 20. <br>
For N = 5 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 5 and visited nodes = 98. <br>
for N = 10 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 10 and visited nodes = 12508. <br>
for N = 20 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 23 and visited nodes = 46542. <br>

The second solution also produces results in a reasonable time only up to N = 20, is also optimal, but visited less nodes than the fist solution. 
For N = 5 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 5 and visited nodes = 94. <br>
for N = 10 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 10 and visited nodes = 11708. <br>
for N = 20 the optimal solution has total number of elements = 23 and visited nodes = 35711. <br>

The last solution produces result that are not optimal, but is much faster. <br>
For N = 5 the solution has total number of elements = 6 and visited nodes = 4 <br>
for N = 10 the solution has total number of elements = 12 and visited nodes = 3 <br>
for N = 20 the solution has total number of elements = 41 and visited nodes = 26 <br>
For N = 100 the solution has total number of elements = 310 and visited nodes = 10 <br>
For N = 500 the solution has total number of elements = 2031 and visited nodes = 1935 <br>
For N = 1000 the solution has total number of elements = 4275 and visited nodes = 29
